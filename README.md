# Azimuthal Dust Profiles

This module contains the analytic function and some helper functions from the paper
[Birnstiel et al. 2013](https://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201220847).

To install it, clone it and then inside the folder call

    pip install -e .

Examples are in the [notebooks folder](notebooks/). The notebook can be
converted into an executable script like this:

    jupyter nbconvert --to python azimuthal.ipynb

the result can then be run with

    python azimuthal.py

for the help, execute:

    python azimuthal.py -h
